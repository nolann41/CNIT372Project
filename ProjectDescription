Introductions and Problem Description:
The members of our group are Alvin Li, Nate Nolan, and Sean Huynh. We have chosen to pursue option A: viewing YouTube from the perspective of a content consumer. 
We selected this option because we all shared the experience of consuming YouTube content in the past. Therefore we could perhaps relate better to the average consumer and know what
information is important to them compared to the perspectives of journalists or content creators. Important Data: One important piece of data to decipher the interests of content
consumers is the genre of each video. This will be vital in determining what types of videos each consumer is drawn to. Another piece of data we plan to use extensively is average
watch time per video, which will help decipher the video-watching habits of consumers. Other important information would be how often the consumer sits through the entirety of ads
as well as the types of ads they watch.. This data would illustrate how many and what kind of advertisements consumers are generally willing to watch which could improve the overall
viewing experience. This can further be divided in when and what times users will tend to skip or exit the video, determining which portions of the video were wathed more or less than
others. This could also include, like above, ads pertaining to sponsors and sections dedicated to intros, outros, and shoutouts. 

Database Schema:
The database will be made up of multiple tables. Our main table will be the Videos table, where there will be information such as video ID (number, not null), video name(varchar2), 
video description(varchar2), video length(number), genreID(number), upload date (date), and likes (int). We are going to have a table that contains information that pertains to the 
genre of each video. This will contain genre names (varchar2), genre descriptions (varchar2), genre IDs (number, not null). We will have a table for watch duration, which will list 
video IDs, duration length(number), point of skip (number), and point of exit (number) We will have a table pertaining to ads, which will act as a record for how many times an ad is
shown. Each occurrence will have an adplay ID (number, not null), an ad description (varchar2), and ad duration (number). These tables will allow for us to address the questions that
our study is focused on, as well as make sure that the tables are interlinked and can be used together.
